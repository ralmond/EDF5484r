Calculates SE of diff.
$$z = \sqrt{2*p*(1-p)/n}$$
Calculates sample size needed for default s.e.
$$n = 2*p*(1-p)/z^2$$

```{r}
sediff <- function(n,p) {
  sqrt(2*p*(1-p)/n)
}
sampdif <- function(p,z) {
  2*p*(1-p)/z^2
}
```

Target of 5% se of diff, how big does samples size (in each arm of study) need to be.
```{r}
curve(sampdif(x,.05),xlim=c(.1,.9))
```
How big is the se as a function of p for fixed sample size.
```{r}
curve(sediff(200,x),xlim=c(.1,.9))
```
