This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Gelman and Hill Problem 4.1

log(weight) = -3.5 + 2.0 log(height) + error
sd(error) = .25

a) Approximately 68% of persons have a weight within a factor of `r exp(-.25)` and `r exp(.25)` of their predicted value.

```{r}
exp(c(-.25,.25))
```

b) simulate some data and draw a regression line and scatterplot.
```{r}
N <- 100L
height <- rnorm(N,66,4)
weight <- exp(-3.5+2.0*log(height)+rnorm(N,0,.25))
plot(height,weight,main="Log Regression, linear axis",
     xlab="Height (inches)",ylab="Weight (lbs)")
curve(exp(-3.5+2.0*log(x)),add=TRUE)

```
Putting the axis on the log scale using the log="xy"

```{r}
N <- 100L
height <- rnorm(N,66,4)
weight <- exp(-3.5+2.0*log(height)+rnorm(N,0,.25))
plot(height,weight,log="xy",main="Log Regression, log axis",
     xlab="Height (inches)",ylab="Weight (lbs)")
curve(exp(-3.5+2.0*log(x)),add=TRUE)

```
